#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "LFSR PRNG"      # Project title
  description:  "8 bit linear feedback shift register pseudorandom number generator"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "8 D flip flops make a shift register. The 4th, 5th, and 8th bits are XOR'd into the 1st bit on each cycle, giving a cycle of 255 bit permutations. Another layer of flip flops delays the output by 1 cycle to facilitate holding."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set clock to any frequency, power enable input, outputs should be randomized. Outputs should be in the range [1, 255], with a period of 255."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     6000    # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.

    - enable            # on to cycle the shift register
    - hold              # on to hold the output while cycling the internal shift register, connect to external clock to make PRNG less predictable.
